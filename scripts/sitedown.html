<p>Dear member, this is to inform you that CrystalSpot.net will be taking a break; this is to allow for the implementation of some very important updates and improvements that will further enhance our services to you.</p>

<p>To this end, our web services during this period will be very limited. However, necessary information and scholarships will be available via our <a href='http://crystalspot.net/web/rss.php'>newsfeed</a> and social media accounts (http://facebook.com/crystalspot, http://twitter.com/crystalspot, http://plus.google.com/111518550646723312608).</p>

<p>We sincerely apologise for the inconveniences this will allow and request you bear with us.</p>

<p>We look forth to seeing you after the review.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

</p>Oskarr3<br/>
CrystalSpot UI team.</p>
